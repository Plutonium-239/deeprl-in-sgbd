**Summary of work done**

#### **Orders:**

I have tested out a few and decided on a system to implement stochastic order generation. This generates orders for the scheduling horizon specified by the environment's `k`. 
The specifics of the order system needed to be ironed out before the environment could be finished (as taking a step in the environment invloves details like what order was delayed, what order was delivered, what are the costs (and income) of each order *[required for the reward function]*)

An order 'sheet'/'book' will look something like this: 

| idx  | order_date | due_date | amount | margin | product |
| :--: | :--------: | :------: | :----: | :----: | :-----: |
|  0   |     3      |    5     | 100.0  |  29.5  |    A    |
|  1   |     7      |    9     | 100.0  |  63.1  |    A    |
|  2   |     9      |    10    | 100.0  |  33.5  |    A    |
|  3   |     2      |    3     | 100.0  |  8.4   |    B    |
|  4   |     4      |    6     | 100.0  |  46.9  |    D    |
|  5   |     0      |    0     | 100.0  |  58.3  |    A    |
|  6   |     1      |    5     | 100.0  |  13.3  |    C    |
|  7   |     4      |    8     | 100.0  |  19.1  |    D    |
|  8   |     7      |    10    | 100.0  |  55.1  |    C    |
|  9   |     7      |    10    | 100.0  |  48.6  |    D    |

Every order has 5 properties alongside the `index`/`idx`:

1. **`order_date`:** The date on which that order is **placed** (so to the agent, only orders placed upto that date will be visible, for e.g., only orders with `order_date â‰¤ 2`*[order ids 3, 5, 7, 9]* will be visible to the agent at day 0 of the simulation).
	This is sampled from a discrete uniform distribution from `0` to the last day, i.e. `k`(in our environment) 
2. **`due_date`:** The last date by which that order is to be **delivered** without any tardiness costs (after that day tardiness costs will be applied as 25% for each succesive late day). 
	This is taken as the `order_date` + a *delay*, sampled from a discrete uniform distribution from `0` to `k/2`. *[`k\2` was chosen arbitrarily so that most orders have `>2` days in between `order_date` and this `due_date`]* 
3. **`amount`**: The **amount of product ordered** to be produced. Currently this is a constant.
4. **`margin`**: The **financial gain** from delivering that order on/before time.
	This is sampled as a number from a standard normal distribution (`Z(mean=0, std=1)`) multiplied by the amount (so that in future even if we change amounts to be unequal, this already takes it into consideration *[since more amount of product ordered usually refers to more money spent]*)
5. **`product`:** This tells us **which product** is ordered out of a variable number of products. *[For the environment the default is 5 products `A`,`B`,`C`,`D`,`E`]*. 
	This is randomly chosen from all the products. *[i.e., a uniform discrete distribution]*

#### Agents: 

The agents implemented are **`DDPG`** (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) and `PPO` (Proximal Policy Optimization).

I need to implement `A2C` (Advantage Actor-Critic) or `A3C` (Asynchronous A2C) agents. 

I'm using PyTorch to implement the neural network part in any of these.

I have additionaly made a graphic demonstrating the basic environment model and flow of components/mixtures (for the final report).
