# deeprl-in-sgbd

This repository contains all the work I have done in the CLD771 Minor Project on applying Deep Reinforcement Learning.

The [`rl examples`]() folder contains implementations of various RL techniques like Q-learning, DQN, the REINFORCE algorithm etc. 

The [`custom_env` ]() folder contains the starting code of the main environment (from Paper 1)
