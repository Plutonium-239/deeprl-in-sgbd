# deeprl-in-sgbd

This repository contains all the work I have done in the CLD771 Minor Project on applying Deep Reinforcement Learning.

The [`rl examples`](/rl%20examples) folder contains implementations of various RL techniques like Q-learning, DQN, the REINFORCE algorithm etc. 

The [`sgbd-env` ](/SGBD-env) folder contains the code of the main environment
