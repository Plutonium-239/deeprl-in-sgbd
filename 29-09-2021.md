### Minimal example:

Let `i=3, j=2, n=2, p=2, o=1`, 

where, `i = component tanks` , `j = product tanks`, `n = blenders`, `p = products`, `o = orders`
analogous to this image taken from [Bayu, Panda, Shaik and Ramteke, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compchemeng.2019.106636): ![img](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0098135419308713-gr1_lrg.jpg)

A `unit` is any of the component tanks, product tanks or blenders. 

The `observation_space` includes values of (either all periods or just last period):

- inventory levels of component tanks, product tanks 
- blending rates in the blenders
- amounts transferred in between units and from product tanks to orders.
